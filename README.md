# Rosemeri Borges
<sub>*Data Science student* at Unopar University</sub>

Passionate about technology, data and innovation! I'm very curious, I like to learn new things, I really believe that if everything we do is with love and being our best we will be making a difference with our work, regardless of what it is, I love solving problems the problem is more interesting than the solution I like challenges, I believe that we only fail if we give up!
I'm 39 and after my children were taken care of, my marriage stabilized, I decided to dedicate myself to my passion which is Data Science.
